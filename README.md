# Raycast extension for opening 1Password GitLab references

When creating detailed changelog entries on [releases.1password.com](https://releases.1password.com) we often need to open the corresponding MR or Issue in the Core repo.

This Raycast extension parses the selected text in the active application to find the GitLab reference and then opens the page in your default browser.
